# Paw Park Pulse Privacy Policy

Last Updated: October 7, 2025

(Non‑legal summary) You create an account, optionally add profile + dog info, and use location to find parks. We log anonymous subscription attempt events (you can turn this off). We don’t sell your data. If you delete your account, we delete your personal data and photos. There is no end‑to‑end encryption; standard platform security applies.

## 1. Overview
Paw Park Pulse ("Paw Park Pulse", "we", "us", or "the App") helps dog owners discover dog parks, check in, and share community input. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, and your choices. By using the App you agree to this Policy.

You must not use the App if you disagree with this Policy.

## 2. Scope
This Policy applies to the Paw Park Pulse mobile application and any related in‑app features. It does not cover third‑party websites or services we do not control.

## 3. Data We Collect
We aim to collect the minimum necessary to operate the App.

### 3.1 Account & Authentication
- Email address (or Apple Sign In relay/identifier)
- Display name / username
- Internal authentication identifiers (stored by Firebase Auth)

### 3.2 Profile (Optional Fields You Provide)
- Profile photo
- Dog names, breed(s), basic notes

### 3.3 Location Data (Permission Based)
- Device location (approximate or precise depending on your device settings) used to: show nearby parks, support check‑ins, and map features.
Location data is not sold and is not shared with advertisers.

### 3.4 User-Generated Content (UGC)
- Park photos you upload
- Park check‑ins
- Park change / improvement suggestions
- Other text or media you voluntarily submit

### 3.5 Subscription & Purchase Metadata
- Subscription tier (Single or Family)
- Renewal status, product identifiers, expiration date
(No full payment card data—Apple handles billing.)

### 3.6 Support Communications
- Emails or messages you send to our support address

### 3.7 Technical & Basic Operational Data
- Device OS/version, app version (used only to ensure compatibility)
- Error or crash context automatically provided by the operating system (if any)

### 3.8 Minimal Operational Analytics (Anonymous / Opt-Out)
We log a very limited internal event when a user initiates a subscription attempt so we can understand paywall performance and reliability.
Event fields:
- action (e.g., "subscription_attempt")
- plan (single | family)
- source (UI context, e.g., paywall_cta, plan_change)
- timestamp
- user_id (UID or "anonymous" if not signed in at that moment)
No advertising identifiers, no precise location, and no payment card data are included. You can disable this logging at any time via Settings > Account > Anonymous Analytics toggle. When disabled, no new events are written (existing historical events are not retroactively removed but can be deleted upon verified request, subject to legal limits).

### Not Collected
- No advertising identifiers are currently used.
- No third‑party marketing analytics SDKs (e.g., ad networks) are integrated.

If this changes, we will update this Policy before enabling broader analytics.

## 4. How We Use Your Data
We use data to:
- Provide and maintain core functionality (authentication, park search, check‑ins)
- Display and attribute your submitted content
- Operate subscriptions and entitlement validation (Single $2.99 / Family $9.99 — pricing may vary by region/tax)
- Moderate or remove content that violates our Terms
- Respond to support requests
- Improve reliability and fix bugs (e.g., by using crash or error info)
- Measure general subscription flow interest (anonymous event logging, opt‑out available)
- Enforce Terms of Use and protect against abuse or fraud
- Comply with applicable legal obligations

## 5. Legal Basis (International Users)
The App is operated from the United States (West Virginia). If you access it from other regions, processing may rely on:
- Contract (providing the service you requested)
- Legitimate interests (service reliability, fraud prevention, minimal operational analytics)
- Consent (precise location access, optional profile fields)
- Legal obligation (records retention if required by law)
For jurisdictions requiring it, we honor opt‑out to limit processing for analytics beyond essential service operation.

## 6. Sharing & Disclosure
We do **not** sell or rent personal data.
We may disclose limited data to:
- Service Providers: Firebase (authentication, Firestore storage), Apple (Sign In & App Store billing), cloud storage/CDN services for images.
- Legal & Safety: When required by law, subpoena, or to protect rights, safety, or integrity of the service.
- Business Transfer: If we undergo a merger, acquisition, or asset sale (you will be notified where legally required).

Public Content: Photos, park suggestions, and display names you intentionally submit for public display may be visible to other users.

## 7. Data Retention & Deletion
- Active Account: Retained while your account exists.
- Account Deletion: When you request deletion (or use an in‑app delete feature), we delete personal profile data, subscription linkage, dog info, and user photos. Deletion is initiated promptly and ordinarily completes within 24 hours; residual encrypted backups (if any) are overwritten on normal rotation (typically ≤ 30 days).
- Public Contributions: Park photos and suggestions are also removed unless required for legal reasons (e.g., abuse investigation); if retained, they are anonymized.
- Minimal Analytics Events: Retained up to 12 months (rolling) for trend and fraud detection, then purged or aggregated. Earlier deletion can be requested (we may need to retain some events for anti‑abuse or legal purposes).

You can request deletion by emailing: ray@lowrynet.com (from the email associated with your account) if an in‑app option is not yet available.

## 8. Your Choices & Rights
- Location: Disable in device settings to stop location access (core location‑based features will degrade).
- Anonymous Analytics: Toggle on/off in Account Settings. Off = no new operational subscription attempt events stored.
- Profile Edits: Modify or remove optional profile fields in the app (when UI available) or by contacting support.
- Deletion: Request account deletion as described above.
- International Rights: Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., EU/EEA/UK, some U.S. states), you may have rights to access, rectify, delete, restrict, object, or portability. We will honor valid requests subject to identity verification and legal limits.

## 9. Children
The App is not directed to children under 13 and is not intended for anyone below the minimum digital consent age in their jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect data from children. Contact us if you believe a child has used the service so we can remove the account.

## 10. Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures proportionate to the nature of the data:
- Transport security (TLS) for data in transit between the app and backend services.
- Access controls restricted to operational personnel.
- Authentication handled via Firebase Auth.
Important: **No end‑to‑end encryption** of user-generated content is provided. Data at rest may rely on platform (e.g., Firebase / cloud provider) encryption rather than custom application‑level encryption. While we strive to protect data, no system is perfectly secure. Report potential vulnerabilities to ray@lowrynet.com.

## 11. International Transfers
Data may be stored or processed in the United States or other regions where our infrastructure or service providers operate. By using the App you consent to these transfers. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) for cross‑border transfers of personal data.

## 12. Third-Party Services & Links
External links or embedded resources (if any) are governed by their own policies. Review their privacy practices separately.

## 13. Do Not Track
We do not currently respond to browser or platform "Do Not Track" signals.

## 14. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Policy. The “Last Updated” date reflects the latest revision. Material changes may be highlighted in‑app or via notice. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.

## 15. Contact
Questions, requests, or concerns:
- Email: ray@lowrynet.com
- (Postal address may be added if required by applicable law.)

## 16. California / U.S. State Notices (General Statement)
We do not sell personal information and do not share it for cross‑context behavioral advertising. If state privacy laws grant you specific rights beyond those listed, contact us and we will process requests consistent with applicable law.

## 17. Future Features / Analytics Expansion Disclaimer
If we later introduce broader analytics, advertising, or additional data uses, we will update this Policy and, where required, request consent before activation.
